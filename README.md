# diskgover

> **Note:** This is a learning project to improve Go skills. It may or may not evolve into a full rewrite of [diskover](https://github.com/diskoverdata/diskover-community). Expect experiments, iterations, and breaking changes.

## About

diskgover is a personal exploration into building disk indexing and analysis tools with Go. The project serves as a hands-on way to learn:

- Go project structure and best practices
- File system operations and traversal
- Concurrent programming patterns
- Performance optimization
- Data indexing and storage strategies

## Project Status

🚧 **Early Development** - Currently setting up the foundation. No functional code yet.

This is a public learning repository. Code quality will improve over time as I learn and refactor.

## Goals

- Learn Go by building something practical
- Understand disk scanning and indexing challenges
- Experiment with different approaches to file system analysis
- Practice clean, idiomatic Go code

## Non-Goals

- Production-ready software (at least not initially)
- Feature parity with existing tools
- Stable APIs or guarantees
